In this mini-game we can see a hero figthing for avoiding unhealthy food.
So, this game consists in avoiding all kind of obstacles coming from the sky (and from the lateral sides of the screen) moving our character to the right, to the left and jumping (double jump is available).
We have 3 levels with their own 'obstacles', and each level is completed by holding on an amount of time (never more than 2 minutes).

Controls: 

A - Right

D - Left

SPACE - Jump (twice = double jump)

What we can see in this project?

This game is mostly created as a first step to learn how to program and organize a project in Godot Engine.
Hence, it will be normal to see some mistakes in both fields, but at least I have learnt a lot of new things I can implement in my new projects (which hopefully will be bigger and better than this) :^)

Some things we find in this project:

- Object instancing (easy ones and others with their own timers and conditions)
- Simple object / enemy AI
- Character movement (right, left and double jump)
- Simple life system
- Simple animations
- Scene changes
- UI basics
